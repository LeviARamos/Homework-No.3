        [Verse 1]
        I can't make my own decisions
        Or make any with precision
        Well, maybe you should tie me up
        So I don't go where you don't want me
        You say that I've been changing
        That I'm not just simply aging
        Yeah, how could that be logical?
        Just keep on cramming ideas down my throat
    
        [Pre-Chorus]
        Woah
    
        [Chorus]
        You don't have to believe me
        But the way I, way I see it
        Next time you point a finger
        I might have to bend it back or break it, break it off
        Next time you point a finger
        I'll point you to the mirror
    
        [Verse 2]
        If God's the game that you're playing
        Well, we must get more acquainted
        Because it has to be so lonely
        To be the only one who's holy
        It's just my humble opinion
        But it's one that I believe in
        You don't deserve a point of view
        If the only thing you see is you
        You might also like
      
        [Pre-Chorus]
        Woah
    
        [Chorus]
        You don't have to believe me
        But the way I, way I see it
        Next time you point a finger
        I might have to bend it back or break it, break it off
        Next time you point a finger
        I'll point you to the mirror
    
        [Bridge]
        This is the last second chance
        (I'll point you to the mirror)
        I'm half as good as it gets
        (I'll point you to the mirror)
        I'm on both sides of the fence
        (I'll point you to the mirror)
        Without a hint of regret
        I'll hold you to it
    
        [Chorus]
        I know you don't believe me
        But the way I, way I see it
        Next time you point a finger
        I might have to bend it back or break it, break it off
        Next time you point a finger
        I'll point you to the mirror
        I know you won't believe me
        But the way I, way I see it
        Next time you point a finger
        I might have to bend it back or break it, break it off
        Next time you point a finger
        I'll point you to the mirror
